# CppChess

This is an attempt to make the game of Chess purely in C++. My current goal is to have local multiplayer in a terminal
application.

The current to-do list is:

* Disallow moving into check
* Add castling
* Add en passant

Completed goals so far:

* Add rendering
* Add input
* Add win conditions
