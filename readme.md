# CppChess

This is an attempt to make the game of Chess purely in C++. My current goal is to have local multiplayer in a terminal
application.

The current goal list is:

* Add win conditions
* Disallow moving into check
* Add castling
* Add en passant
* Add rendering
* Add input

Future goals include:

* Networked multiplayer
* Graphics mode
